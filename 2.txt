Yes, you can pass lambda expressions as arguments to methods in Java. This is commonly done to provide behavior or functionality that the method can execute. Let's see how this works with an example.

### Example: Passing Lambda Expressions to a Method

Let's create an example where we pass a lambda expression to a method that processes a list of strings.

#### Step 1: Define a Functional Interface

First, define a functional interface with a single abstract method:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface StringProcessor {
    void process(String s);
}
```

#### Step 2: Create a Method that Accepts the Functional Interface

Next, create a method that accepts an instance of this functional interface:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class LambdaDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = Arrays.asList("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date");

        // Pass a lambda expression as an argument
        processStrings(list, s -> System.out.println(s.toUpperCase()));

        // Another example with different behavior
        processStrings(list, s -> System.out.println(s.length()));
    }

    public static void processStrings(List<String> list, StringProcessor processor) {
        for (String s : list) {
            processor.process(s);
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Functional Interface**: `StringProcessor` is a functional interface with a single abstract method `process`.

2. **Method with Lambda Argument**: The `processStrings` method accepts a `StringProcessor` instance. This method iterates through the list and applies the `process` method to each string.

3. **Passing Lambda Expressions**: In the `main` method, we pass different lambda expressions to `processStrings`.
    - `s -> System.out.println(s.toUpperCase())`: This lambda expression converts each string to uppercase and prints it.
    - `s -> System.out.println(s.length())`: This lambda expression prints the length of each string.

### Benefits

- **Flexibility**: You can change the behavior of the `processStrings` method without modifying its implementation by passing different lambda expressions.
- **Code Reusability**: The `processStrings` method is reusable with any behavior that matches the `StringProcessor` functional interface.

### Example Output

The output of the above program will be:

```
APPLE
BANANA
CHERRY
DATE
5
6
6
4
```

In this example, the first call to `processStrings` prints each string in uppercase, and the second call prints the length of each string.
